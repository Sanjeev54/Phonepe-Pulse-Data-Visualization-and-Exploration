# Process
# Data extraction: 
Cloning the Github using scripting to fetch the data from the Phonepe pulse Github repository and store it in a suitable format such as CSV or JSON.
# Data transformation: 
Using Python, along with libraries such as Pandas, to manipulate and pre-process the data. This may include cleaning the data, handling missing values, and transforming the data into a format suitable for analysis and visualization.
# Database insertion: 
Using the "mysql-connector-python" library in Python to connect to a MySQL database and insert the transformed data using SQL commands.
# Dashboard creation: 
Using the Streamlit and Plotly libraries in Python to create an interactive and visually appealing dashboard. Plotly's built-in geo map functions is used to display the data on a map and Streamlit is used to create a user-friendly interface with multiple dropdown options for users to select different facts and figures to display.
# Data retrieval: 
Using the "mysql-connector-python" library to connect to the MySQL database and fetch the data into a Pandas dataframe. Using the data in the dataframe, the dashboard is updated dynamically.
# Libraries Used
repo for cloning, pandas, json, os, mysql.connector, plotly.express, streamlit
